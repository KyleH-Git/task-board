## Description

This site is a kanban task board that allows users to adds tasks and organize them as to-do, in progress, or done. It allows users to input a task title, due date, and task description as well. If a task is due on the current day, or is past due, the task card will change colors. A delete button allows users to remove tasks from the board that no longer need to be tracked.
